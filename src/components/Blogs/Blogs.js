                        <p className="md:pl-0 md:col-span-7">React Router, and dynamic, client-side routing, allows us to build a single-page web application with navigation without the page refreshing as the user navigates. React Router uses component structure and object structure to call components, which display the appropriate information. By preventing a page refresh, and using Router or Link, which is explained in more depth below, the flash of a white screen or blank page is prevented. This is one increasingly common way of having a more seamless user experience. React router also allows the user to utilize browser functionality like the back button and the refresh page while maintaining the correct view of the application.</p>

                        <p className="md:pl-0 md:col-span-7">The React Context API is a way for a React app to effectively produce global variables that can be passed around. This is the alternative to "prop drilling" or moving props from grandparent to child to parent, and so on. Context is also touted as an easier and lighter approach. In a typical React application, data is passed top-down (parent to child) via props, but such usage can be cumbersome for certain types of props (e.g. locale preference, UI theme) that are required by many components within an application. Context provides a way to share values like these between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree.</p>

                        <h3 className="font-semibold md:col-span-5">What is useRef?</h3>
                        <p className="md:pl-0 md:col-span-7">The useRef Hook allows you to persist values between renders. It can be used to store a mutable value that does not cause a re-render when updated. It can be used to access a DOM element directly. useRef hook is part of the React Hooks API. It is a function which takes a maximum of one argument and returns an Object. The returned object has a property called current whose value is the argument passed to useRef. If you invoke it without an argument, the returned object's current property is set to undefined. The code below illustrates how to invoke the useRef hook in functional components.</p>
